- `merge_message_runs` 工具使得合并连续的同类型消息变得简单

```python
from langchain_core.messages import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage,
    merge_message_runs,
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage("you're a good assistant."),
    SystemMessage("you always respond with a joke."),
    HumanMessage([{"type": "text", "text": "i wonder why it's called langchain"}]),
    HumanMessage("and who is harrison chasing anyways"),
    AIMessage(
        'Well, I guess they thought "WordRope" and "SentenceString" just didn\'t have the same ring to it!'
    ),
    AIMessage("Why, he's probably chasing after the last cup of coffee in the office!"),
]

merged = merge_message_runs(messages)
print("\n\n".join([repr(x) for x in merged]))
"""
-------------- output ---------------
SystemMessage(content="you're a good assistant.\nyou always respond with a joke.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})

HumanMessage(content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': "i wonder why it's called langchain"}, 'and who is harrison chasing anyways'], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})

AIMessage(content='Well, I guess they thought "WordRope" and "SentenceString" just didn\'t have the same ring to it!\nWhy, he\'s probably chasing after the last cup of coffee in the office!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})

如果要合并的消息之一的内容是内容块列表，则合并后的消息将具有内容块列表。如果两个要合并的消息都具有字符串内容，则它们将使用换行符连接。
